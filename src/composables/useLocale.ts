 * Region → script/region alias map for browsers that report a language the

 * bundles unambiguously. The keys are the tags LibreOffice/Safari/Firefox/
 * Chromium emit from `navigator.language` or from the `lang` URL parameter;
 * the values are the exact tags in src/locales/*.json.
 *
 * Two classes of entry live here:
 *
 * - **Single-bundle region tags** (`cs-CZ`, `uk-UA`): a region the browser
 *   reports but the bundle does not ship verbatim, with exactly one
 *   bundled locale sharing the base language. Routing it to that base
 *   bundle is unambiguous — there is no sibling to pick wrong. The
 *   `uk-UA` → `uk` alias closes #905. Single-bundle languages without a
 *   region (e.g. `eo`, where browsers send the bare tag because Esperanto
 *   has no associated region subtag) exact-match through the first
 *   `resolveLocale` branch and need no alias entry.
 * - **Simplified-Chinese region tags** (`zh-CN`, `zh-SG`, `zh-MY`): a
 *   browser with no Simplified-Chinese bundle of its own must reach the
 *   only Simplified-Chinese bundle (`zh-Hans`). Traditional-Chinese
 *   regions (`zh-HK`, `zh-TW`) each have their own bundle; the
 *   script-side region `zh-MO` is not aliased and has no bundle of its
 *   own, so it falls to the default. Collapsing any of them onto another
 *   Chinese bundle would pick the wrong orthography for a real user.
 *
 * Adding more aliases is allowed only when the alias target is the *only*
 * bundle the source language ships. Generic subtag fallback (bare `zh` →
 * `zh-Hans`) is intentionally absent: it lets a single browser tag resolve
 * through any of N siblings, which is how a bundle gets rendered in the
 * wrong script for a real user.
